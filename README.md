Week1 assignment

Here are the answer to the following questions.

1. Implement a basic measure of tracking the time taken to run an algorithm.
2. Implement a basic measure of tracking the space used by an algorithm.
3. Implement the following 3 algorithms:
     a.Find the maximum value in a list 
     b.Make each letter in a string lowercase
     c.Sort a list of integers (using the inbuilt python method)
4. For each of the above algorithms, plot graphs showing how the time and space taken as the input size changes from length 1 to length 100. (Lengths of lists and lengths of strings). You donâ€™t need all values - just a few (e.g. 3) is enough.
5. Estimate how long each algorithm would take for inputs of size 1,000,000. Write your estimate clearly in the code.


You'll need an IDE (Python compatible) ex: Visual Basics
